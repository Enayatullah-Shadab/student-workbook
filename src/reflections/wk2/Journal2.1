## What is Scope ?
Scope is the accessibility of variables that determines when
we can use a variable and when can not use it.

## What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is the relation and positioning of a variable compare to the a function or execution part of the code to be declared before or after of execution obr 
the block, that position is matter.
it is recommended to be used let and const instead of var for preventing hoisting issue.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
we use var when we need to declare variable after the console,
 while we use let and const when declaring at the top of the scope.
